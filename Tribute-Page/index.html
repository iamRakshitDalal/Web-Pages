            <p>
              Maharana Pratap was a legendary Rajput king of Mewar, born on 9
              May 1540 in Kumbhalgarh, Rajasthan, and is remembered for his
              unwavering resistance against the Mughal emperor Akbar. He
              ascended the throne in 1572 and devoted his life to protecting the
              independence, culture, and honor of his kingdom. Unlike many other
              Rajput rulers, Maharana Pratap refused to accept Mughal supremacy,
              which led to the famous Battle of Haldighati in 1576. Although the
              battle did not result in a decisive victory for Mewar, Maharana
              Pratap’s courage, determination, and guerrilla warfare tactics
              allowed him to continue resisting Mughal forces for years. With
              the loyal support of his generals, especially Bhil warriors and
              his trusted companion Bhamashah, he gradually reclaimed much of
              his lost territory. Maharana Pratap lived a life of hardship and
              sacrifice, choosing freedom over comfort, and remains a powerful
              symbol of bravery, patriotism, and self-respect in Indian history.
